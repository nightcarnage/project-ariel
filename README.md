# Project Ariel

**Liberating the ASRock BC-250.**

Project Ariel is [Cachenetics'](https://cachenetics.com) open-source effort to reverse
engineer and liberate the ASRock BC-250 - a Zen 2 + RDNA accelerator on a harvested AMD
console-class APU (codename *Ariel*, PCI `1002:13FE`), built by the tens of thousands for a
crypto workload that evaporated and now sold as e-waste: 16 GB of unified memory and a real
GPU, locked down and underclocked as shipped.

We tear down the firmware and the silicon - mapping SMU mailboxes, freeing the full GPU,
retraining memory, and lifting the factory clock and power limits - to unlock hardware the
vendor left crippled. The result is a board that punches well above its throwaway price:
console-class compute for the cost of e-waste. All open, all reproducible, all documented.

## Tools

- **[arieltune](arieltune/)** - the unified BC-250 tuning suite. One tabbed TUI + CLI
  (WIKI / BIOS / APU / MEM): browse the firmware surface, tune GDDR6 memory timings, unlock
  and tune the APU (40-CU liberation, CPU/GPU/CU control), and read the hardware-verified
  BC-250 manual. Built on reverse-engineered SMU mailboxes and a liberated amdgpu.
- **[llmtune](https://github.com/cachenetics/llmtune)** - once the board is liberated, serves
  LLMs on it (llama.cpp orchestration, model hot-swap, OpenAI-compatible endpoint, fleet mode
  for a rack of BC-250s).

New board, starting from a fresh OS install: llmtune's
[docs/bc250-complete-bringup.md](https://github.com/cachenetics/llmtune/blob/main/docs/bc250-complete-bringup.md)
walks the whole path end to end, arieltune liberation through serving a model.

## Get it running

Runs on a **BC-250** (or an Ariel-APU board) under Linux x86-64. You need a Rust
toolchain to build ([rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs)) and `root` for any actuation.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cachenetics/project-ariel.git
cd project-ariel
./install.sh                 # build (release) + install to /usr/local/bin
arieltune                    # launch the TUI (opens on WIKI)
```

`install.sh` installs one binary (`arieltune`), a short `at` alias, and
`aputune`/`memtune`/`biostune`/`wikitune` compat symlinks. Jump straight to a tab with
`arieltune apu` (or `bios` / `mem` / `wiki`); everything is also scriptable from the CLI.
See [`arieltune/README.md`](arieltune/README.md) for the full build/usage guide.

A Rust toolchain is only enough to build `arieltune` itself. Building the *patched kernel*
later (`arieltune apu build`/`liberate`) needs a bigger toolchain (gcc15, rust-bindgen,
rust-src, and more; the kernel build is gcc - clang/llvm/lld only if you deliberately
choose an LLVM-LTO flavour) - follow [`arieltune/README.md`](arieltune/README.md)'s own
"Build dependencies" section before running that step, do not assume the Rust toolchain
above already covers it.

## Safety

These tools **write hardware** - SMU registers, CMOS/NVRAM, SPI flash, memory training. A
bad value can fail to POST and need a power-cycle or CMOS-clear. Read each tool's
`SECURITY.md` and its inline safety notes first; firmware and memory tuning are done at your
own risk, on hardware you own.

## Credits

This suite is the work of the BC-250 community. It exists because people did the hard
measurement on real hardware and shared it.

Core of this release:

- **nightcarnage** - the liberation suite, end to end: the amdgpu kernel patch series
  (13-28), the 8-core CPU unlock with its safety gates and Core Map UI, the out-of-tree
  driver fixes (nct6687, smiflash), and the userland tuning tools, plus the C refactors of
  the KIQ/GFXOFF work and the clean-blade validation behind every patch.
- **GabriWar (Gabriel Duarte Guerra)** - the compute-TLB fix (patch 25, `flush-by-runlist`),
  the only invalidation measured to actually work on this silicon; the SMU core-mask unlock
  primitive; the ROCm kernel hardening series; and the MEC firmware disassembly / fault corpus.
- **Fabian** (with **Dani**) - the original GFXOFF-disable and KIQ-bypass fixes (patches
  13/14/15) and the production research repo they stand on.
- **FilippoR** - the 8-core telemetry / core-count helper (patch 28) and the userspace
  gfxclk-query work.
- **neoney** - the KIQ bypass discovery and PASID-flush investigation (patch 21).

Standing on prior BC-250 community work, with thanks:

- **the bc250-collective - mrfrakes and dantistnfs** - who started it all: the original
  board bring-up, SMU mailboxing, and enablement groundwork everything here builds on.
- **duggasco** - the 40-CU enumeration/dispatch research on Cyan Skillfish.
- **WinnieLV** - the live CU manager whose `apply_target_masks` register sequence this ports.
- **ethkey**, the ASRock `bc250_memcfg` / RobinMemTiming work - the memory-timing tooling the
  MEM tab is built on; and **walkjivefly** for taking the first plunge.
- **anrp**, **wtfuzz** - additional findings; and **humvee** and the wider BC-250 Discord
  community for the testing, reports, and momentum that keep this effort moving.

## Licensing

The whole project is **GPL-2.0-only**, matching upstream cachenetics/project-ariel.
Kernel-derived parts (the amdgpu liberation patch series and kernel modules, under
`arieltune/`) inherit the Linux kernel's GPL-2.0 — the same license, no conflict.
