//! APU tab -- the BC-250 APU liberation + CPU/GPU/CU tuner, browse + edit + KAT + CLI.
//!
//! Ported from the standalone `aputune`: `screen` is the interactive four-panel
//! control center (system card / CPU OC / GPU clock / CU routing, live SMU +
//! carrier telemetry, draft-then-apply writes) -- now an
//! [`arieltune_tui_kit::Screen`] the suite shell drives; `cli` is the non-TUI
//! surface (patches/cu/gpu/cpu/profile/build/liberate/doctor).
//!
//! SMU access is shared, not duplicated: the queue-0 GPU PMFW mailbox
//! ([`ariel_smu::smu::Smu`]) and the queue-3 CPU-OC mailbox
//! ([`ariel_smu::ocq3::OcQ3`]) were lifted into `ariel-smu` in M2 with every
//! Vid ceiling / brick guard / clamp verbatim; this crate USES them (it does not
//! carry its own copies). The silicon-generic probes (`ariel_apu_present`,
//! `amdgpu_dbg_dir`, `running_kernel`, `SmnAperture`) come from `ariel-hal`.
//!
//! The CU health-test KAT dispatches through [`ariel_compute::with_session`] on
//! the ONE shared Vulkan device while holding the process-wide compute lock, so a
//! MEM bandwidth bench and an APU KAT can never drive the GPU at once.
//!
//! SAFETY BOUNDARY (design R3/R5): the GPU governor, the poke-driven autosleep,
//! and `gpu apply-boot` run FOREVER and are CLI-ONLY -- the TUI never spawns them
//! in-process (that would hang the event loop and, worse, put a second writer on
//! the SMU). The TUI only edits config + (re)starts the systemd unit; the single
//! `arieltune-gpu.service` daemon is the ONLY SMU clock writer.
