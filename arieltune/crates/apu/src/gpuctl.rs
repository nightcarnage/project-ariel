//! Shared GPU power state-machine transitions — THE one implementation of the
//! force / unforce paths, used by the CLI (`gpu force|unforce`), the TUI, and
//! `profile apply`, so no caller can bypass the safety ordering:
//!
//!   * force: raise a persisted GPU undervolt to the TARGET clock's floor
//!     BEFORE the clock moves (voltage-first — forcing a high clock onto an
//!     undervolt sized for a lower one is the crash class), persist, then make
//!     the single GPU power unit re-enact it.
//!   * unforce: release the clock + voltage, clear ONLY the manual pin
//!     (`auto_mode` is preserved — releasing a pin must not silently flip a
//!     box from autosleep/released to governor), persist, re-enact.
